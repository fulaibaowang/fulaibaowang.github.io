Stumbling into biology as my major during Bachelor's by accident (literally), I felt, among all the subjects in biology, bioinformatics might be a good match as I'd been glued to my computer anyway. 

Being not entirely convinced that I could make a living on this and also wanna to see more excited world out there, I left my hometown Shanghai and went for master's studies in Freiburg, Germany. 

Loving the city and having some luck to get a stipend, I stayed for a PhD. Working day and night on the bench and playing with fruit flies, I finally realized that it is indeed possible (and nicer) to do bioinformatics for a living. 

I am currently working as Bioinformatican in Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne.
