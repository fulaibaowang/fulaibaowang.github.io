Stumbling into biology as my major during Bachelor's by accident (literally), I felt, among all the subjects in biology, bioinformatics might be a good match as I'd been glued to my computer anyway. 

Being not entirely convinced that I could make a living on this and also wanna to see more excited world out there, I left my hometown Shanghai and went for master's studies in Freiburg, Germany. 

Loving the city and having some luck to get a stipend, I stayed for a PhD. Working day and night on the bench and playing with fruit flies, I finally realized that it is indeed possible (and nicer) to do bioinformatics for a living. 

After my PhD, I worked as a bioinformatician at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, where I gained broad experience analyzing diverse biological datasets and collaborating on multidisciplinary research projects. 

I am currently a bioinformatician in Julien Gagneurâ€™s lab at the Technical University of Munich, contributing to the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). I serve as a main developer of two open-source bioinformatics workflows, including a quality-control pipeline for genome sequencing centers, and nf-core/drop, a standardized RNA-seq workflow for rare-disease diagnostics.
